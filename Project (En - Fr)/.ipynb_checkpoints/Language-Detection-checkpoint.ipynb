        "On Saturday, the 22nd of March, 1868, my father and I called on Carlyle\n",
        "at 5, Cheyne Row, Chelsea, with a message from one of his intimate\n",
        "friends.\n",
        "\n",
        "We were asked upstairs at once, and found Carlyle at breakfast.  The\n",
        "room was large, well-lighted, a bright fire was burning, and the window\n",
        "was open in order to secure complete ventilation.  Opposite the\n",
        "fireplace was a picture of Frederick the Great and his sister.  There\n",
        "were also other pictures which I had not time to examine.  One of them\n",
        "Carlyle pointed out.  It was a portrait of the Elector of Saxony who\n",
        "assisted Luther.  The letters V.D.M.I.AE.  (\"Verbum Dei Manet in\n",
        "AEternum\") were round it.  Everything in the room was in exact order,\n",
        "there was no dust or confusion, and the books on the shelves were\n",
        "arranged in perfect EVENNESS.  I noticed that when Carlyle replaced a\n",
        "book he took pains to get it level with the others.  The furniture was\n",
        "solid, neat, and I should think expensive.  I showed him the letter he\n",
        "had written to me eighteen years ago.  It has been published by Mr.\n",
        "Froude, but it will bear reprinting.  The circumstances under which it\n",
        "was written, not stated by Mr. Froude, were these.  In 1850, when the\n",
        "Latter-day Pamphlets appeared--how well I remember the eager journey to\n",
        "the bookseller for each successive number!--almost all the reviews\n",
        "united in a howl of execration, criticism so called.  I, being young,\n",
        "and owing so much to Carlyle, wrote to him, the first and almost the\n",
        "only time I ever did anything of the kind, assuring him that there was\n",
        "at least one person who believed in him.  This was his answer:-\n",

        "\"MY GOOD YOUNG FRIEND,--I am much obliged by the regard you entertain\n",
        "for me; and do not blame your enthusiasm, which well enough beseems your\n",
        "young years.  If my books teach you anything, don't mind in the least\n",
        "whether other people believe it or not; but do you for your own behoof\n",
        "lay it to heart as a real acquisition you have made, more properly, as a\n",
        "real message left with you, which YOU must set about fulfilling,\n",
        "whatsoever others do!  This is really all the counsel I can give you\n",
        "about what you read in my books or those of others:  PRACTISE what you\n",
        "learn there; instantly and in all ways begin turning the belief into a\n",
        "fact, and continue at that--till you get more and ever more beliefs,\n",
        "with which also do the like.  It is idle work otherwise to write books\n",
        "or to read them.\n",
        "\n",

        "an earnest life.  The 'people' could not save you with their 'sympathy'\n",
        "if they had never so much of it to give; a man can and must save\n",
        "himself, with or without their sympathy, as it may chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And may all good be with you, my kind young friend, and a heart stout\n",

        "as the body lasts.  The demonstration of the twenty-third proposition is\n",
        "not easy to grasp, but the substance of it is that although the mind is\n",

        "the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Much of the criticism on Milton, if not hostile, is apologetic, and it\n",
        "is considered quite correct to say we \"do not care\" for him.  Partly\n",
        "this indifference is due to his Nonconformity.  The \"superior\"\n",
        "Englishman who makes a jest of the doctrines and ministers of the\n",
        "Established Church always pays homage to it because it is RESPECTABLE,\n",
        "and sneers at Dissent.  Another reason why Milton does not take his\n",
        "proper place is that his theme is a theology which for most people is no\n",
        "longer vital.  A religious poem if it is to be deeply felt must embody a\n",
        "living faith.  The great poems of antiquity are precious to us in\n",
        "proportion to our acceptance, now, as fact, of what they tell us about\n",
        "heaven and earth.  There are only a few persons at present who perceive\n",
        "that in substance the account which was given in the seventeenth century\n",
        "of the relation between man and God is immortal and worthy of epic\n",
        "treatment.  A thousand years hence a much better estimate of Milton will\n",
        "be possible than that which can be formed to-day.  We attribute to him\n",
        "mechanic construction in dead material because it is dead to ourselves.\n",
        "Even Mr. Ruskin who was far too great not to recognise in part at least\n",
        "Milton's claims, says that \"Milton's account of the most important event\n",
        "in his whole system of the universe, the fall of the angels, is\n",
        "evidently unbelievable to himself; and the more so, that it is wholly\n",
        "founded on, and in a great part spoiled and degraded from, Hesiod's\n",
        "account of the decisive war of the younger gods with the Titans.  The\n",
        "rest of his poem is a picturesque drama, in which every artifice of\n",
        "invention is visibly and consciously employed; not a single fact being\n",
        "for an instant conceived as tenable by any living faith\" (Sesame and\n",

        "Mr. Mark Pattison, quoting part of this passage, remarks with justice,\n",
        "\"on the contrary, we shall not rightly apprehend either the poetry or\n",
        "the character of the poet until we feel that throughout Paradise Lost,\n",
        "as in Paradise Regained and Samson, Milton felt himself to be standing\n",
        "on the sure ground of fact and reality\" (English Men of Letters--Milton,\n",
        "p. 186, ed. 1879).\n",
        "\n",
        "St. Jude for ages had been sufficient authority for the angelic revolt,\n",
        "and in a sense it was a reasonable dogma, for although it did not\n",
        "explain the mystery of the origin of evil it pushed it a step further\n",
        "backwards, and without such a revolt the Christian scheme does not well\n",
        "hold together.  So also with the entrance of the devil into the serpent.\n",
        "It is not expressly taught in any passage of the canonical Scriptures,\n",
        "but to the Church and to Milton it was as indisputable as the presence\n",
        "of sin in the world.  Milton, I repeat, BELIEVED in the framework of his\n",
        "poem, and unless we can concede this to him we ought not to attempt to\n",
        "criticise him.  He was impelled to turn his religion into poetry in\n",
        "order to bring it closer to him.  The religion of every Christian if it\n",
        "is real is a poem.  He pictures a background of Holy Land scenery, and\n",
        "he creates a Jesus who continually converses with him and reveals to him\n",
        "much more than is found in the fragmentary details of the Gospels.  When\n",

        "\n",
        "Milton belonged to that order of poets whom the finite does not satisfy.\n",
        "Like Wordsworth, but more eminently, he was \"powerfully affected\" only\n",
        "by that \"which is conversant with or turns upon infinity,\" and man is to\n",
        "him a being with such a relationship to infinity that Heaven and Hell\n",
        "contend over him.  Every touch which sets forth the eternal glory of\n",
        "Heaven and the scarcely subordinate power of Hell magnifies him.\n",
        "Johnson, whose judgment on Milton is unsatisfactory because he will not\n",
        "deliver himself sufficiently to beauty which he must have recognised,\n",
        "nevertheless says of the Paradise Lost, that \"its end is to raise the\n",
        "thoughts above sublunary cares,\" and this is true.  The other great epic\n",
        "poems worthy to be compared with Milton's, the Iliad, Odyssey, AEneid,\n",
        "and Divine Comedy, all agree in representing man as an object of the\n",
        "deepest solicitude to the gods or God.  Milton's conception of God is\n",
        "higher than Homer's, Virgil's, or Dante's, but the care of the Miltonic\n",
        "God for his offspring is greater, and the profound truth unaffected by\n",

        "\n",
        "There is nothing which the most gifted of men can create that is not\n",
        "mixed up with earth, and Milton, too, works it up with his gold.  The\n",
        "weakness of the Paradise Lost is not, as Johnson affirms, its lack of\n",
        "human interest, for the Prometheus Bound has just as little, nor is\n",
        "Johnson's objection worth anything that the angels are sometimes\n",
        "corporeal and at other times independent of material laws.  Spirits\n",
        "could not be represented to a human mind unless they were in a measure\n",
        "subject to the conditions of time and space.  The principal defect in\n",
        "Paradise Lost is the justification which the Almighty gives of the\n",
        "creation of man with a liability to fall.  It would have been better if\n",
        "Milton had contented himself with telling the story of the Satanic\n",
        "insurrection, of its suppression, of its author's revenge, of the\n",
        "expulsion from Paradise, and the promise of a Redeemer.  But he wanted\n",
        "to \"justify the ways of God to man,\" and in order to do this he thought\n",
        "it was necessary to show that man must be endowed with freedom of will,\n",

        "Paradise Regained comes, perhaps, closer to us than Paradise Lost\n",

        "sympathy with him in his admiration of the Elizabethan poets, and my\n",
        "gratitude to him for my recovery passed into affection.  I am sure also\n",
        "that he felt affection for me.  He became confidential, and told me all\n",

        "The town of Langborough in 1839 had not been much disturbed since the\n",
        "beginning of the preceding century.  The new houses were nearly all of\n",
        "them built to replace others which had fallen into decay; there were no\n",
        "drains; the drinking-water came from pumps; the low fever killed thirty\n",
        "or forty people every autumn; the Moot Hall still stood in the middle of\n",
        "the High Street; the newspaper came but once a week; nobody read any\n",
        "books; and the Saturday market and the annual fair were the only events\n",
        "in public local history.  Langborough, being seventy miles from London\n",
        "and eight from the main coach-road, had but little communication with\n",
        "the outside world.  Its inhabitants intermarried without crossing from\n",
        "other stocks, and men determined their choice mainly by equality of\n",
        "fortune and rank.  The shape of the nose and lips and colour of the eyes\n",
        "may have had some influence in masculine selection, but not much:  the\n",
        "doctor took the lawyer's daughter, the draper took the grocer's, and the\n",
        "carpenter took the blacksmith's.  Husbands and wives, as a rule, lived\n",
        "comfortably with one another; there was no reason why they should\n",
        "quarrel.  The air of the place was sleepy; the men attended to their\n",
        "business, and the women were entirely apart, minding their household\n",
        "affairs and taking tea with one another.  In Langborough, dozing as it\n",
        "had dozed since the days of Queen Anne, it was almost impossible that\n",
        "any woman should differ so much from another that she could be the cause\n",
        "of passionate preference.\n",
        "\n",
        "One day in the spring of 1839 Langborough was stirred to its depths.  No\n",

        "thousand pounds in gold with him by the mail, and was met at Thaxton\n",
        "cross-roads by a post-chaise, which was guarded into Langborough by\n",
        "three men with pistols.  A circular printed in London was received on\n",
        "that spring day in 1839 by all the respectable ladies in the town\n",
        "stating that a Mrs. Fairfax was about to begin business in Ferry Street\n",
        "as a dressmaker.  She had taken the only house to be let in Ferry\n",
        "Street.  It was a cottage with a front and back sitting-room, and\n",
        "belonged to an old lady in Lincoln, who inherited it from her brother,\n",

        "attired in an evening robe of rose-coloured silk, the like of which for\n",
        "style and fit no native lady had ever seen.  Underneath it was a card--\n",
        "\"Mrs. Fairfax, Milliner and Dressmaker.\"  The circular stated that Mrs.\n",

        "give was that he was directed at the \"George and Blue Boar\" in Holborn\n",
        "to fetch them from Great Ormond Street.  After much discussion it was\n",
        "agreed that Mrs. Bingham, the wife of the wine merchant, should call on\n",
        "Mrs. Fairfax and inquire the price of a gown.  Mrs. Bingham was at the\n",
        "head of society in Langborough, and had the reputation of being very\n",
        "clever.  It was hoped, and indeed fully expected, that she would be able\n",
        "to penetrate the mystery.  She went, opened the door, a little bell\n",
        "sounded, and Mrs. Fairfax presented herself.  Mrs. Bingham's eyes fell\n",

        "constructed with an accuracy and grace which proved at once to Mrs.\n",

        "complete.  She was a Parisian, father and mother unknown, was found in\n",
        "Paris in 1815 by Captain Fairfax, who, by her intrigues and threats of\n",
        "exposure, was forced into a marriage with her.  A few years afterwards\n",
        "he had grounds for a divorce, but not wishing a scandal, consented to a\n",
        "compromise and voluntary separation.  He left one child in her custody,\n",
        "as it showed signs of resemblance to its mother, to whom he gave a small\n",
        "monthly allowance.  She had been apprenticed as a dressmaker in Paris,\n",
        "had returned thither in order to master her trade, and then came back to\n",
        "England.  In a very little time, so clever was she that she learned to\n",
        "speak English fluently, although, as Mrs. Bingham at once noticed, the\n",
        "French accent was very perceptible.  It was a good, intelligible,\n",

        "so far as her female neighbours were concerned.  To the men in\n",

        "himself, and was much entangled by her dark hair, and was drawn down by\n",

        "strings.  The denial that she minded who knew it may not appear\n",
        "relevant, but desiring to be spiteful she could not at the moment find a\n",
        "better way of showing her spite than by declaring her indifference to\n",
        "the publication of her virtues.  If there was no venom in the substance\n",
        "of the declaration there was much in the manner of it.  Mrs. Bingham\n",

        "please himself.  I'm surprised at you, Miss Tarrant, for YOU'VE always\n",
        "stuck for him through thick and thin.  As for that Mrs. Jenkins, I'll\n",
        "take my Bible oath that the last time she washed for me she stunk of gin\n",
        "enough to poison me, and went away with two bits of soap in her pocket.\n",

        "listen to her.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The ladies came to no conclusion.  Mrs. Bingham said that she had\n",

        "governors was to take place.  There was always a fight at these\n",
        "elections, and this year the Radicals had a strong list.  The Doctor,\n",
        "whose term of office had expired, was the most prominent of the Tory and\n",
        "Church candidates, and never doubted his success.  He was ignorant of\n",
        "all the gossip about him.  One day in that fortnight he might have been\n",
        "seen in Ferry Street.  He went into Mrs. Fairfax's shop and was invited\n",
